.SH NAME
anytopnm - convert an arbitrary type of image file to PBM, PGM, or PPM

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBanytopnm\fP [\fIfile\fP]


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBanytopnm\fP converts the input image, which may be in any of
about 100 graphics formats, to PBM, PGM, or PPM format, depending on
that nature of the input image, and outputs it to Standard Output.
.PP
To determine the format of the input, \fBanytopnm\fP uses the
\fBfile\fP program (possibly assisted by the magic numbers file
fragment included with Netpbm). If that fails (very few image formats
have magic numbers), \fBanytopnm\fP looks at the filename extension.
If that fails, \fBanytopnm\fP punts.
.PP
The type of the output file depends on the input image.
.PP
\fBanytopnm\fP uses the converters for particular graphics formats
that are in the Netpbm package, so it can't convert any format that
you couldn't convert with some other Netpbm program.  What
\fBanytopnm\fP adds is the ability to recognize the format and choose
the appropriate Netpbm program to convert it.  For example, if you
invoke \fBanytopnm\fP on a GIF file, \fBanytopnm\fP will recognize
that it is a GIF file and therefore \fBgiftopnm\fP knows how to
convert it to PNM, so \fBanytopnm\fP invokes \fBgiftopnm\fP.
.PP
\fBanytopnm\fP cannot recognize every possible input format, so you
may still be able to convert an image with a specific Netpbm program when
\fBanytopnm\fP fails to convert it.
.PP
If \fBfile\fP indicates that the input file is compressed (either
via Unix compress, gzip, or bzip compression), \fBanytopnm\fP
uncompresses it and proceeds as above with the uncompressed result.
.PP
If \fBfile\fP indicates that the input file is encoded by uuencode
or btoa, \fBanytopnm\fP decodes it and proceeds as above with the
decoded result.
.PP
If \fIfile\fP is \fB-\fP or not given, \fBanytopnm\fP takes its
input from Standard Input.
.PP
Many image formats are capable of representing multiple images.  In
most cases, \fBanytopnm\fP converts these to multi-image Netpbm images,
but for some formats, \fBanytopnm\fP converts only the first image and
ignores the rest.
.PP
In the case of a multi-image GIF input, \fBanytopnm\fP converts all the
images starting with Netpbm 10.69 (December 2014), but only the first in
earlier releases.
