.SH NAME
fstopgm - convert a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file into a PGM image


.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBfstopgm\fP
[\fIfsfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBfstopgm\fP reads a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file as input and
produces a PGM image as output.
.PP
FaceSaver(tm) files sometimes have rectangular pixels.  While
\fBfstopgm\fP won't re-scale them into square pixels for you, it will
give you the precise \fBpamscale\fP command that will do the job.
Because of this, reading a FaceSaver(tm) image is a two-step process.
First you do:

.nf
  fstopgm > /dev/null
.fi

This will tell you whether you need to use \fBpamscale.\fP

Then use one of the following pipelines:
.nf
  fstopgm | pnmnorm
  fstopgm | pamscale -whatever | pnmnorm
.fi

To go to PBM, you want something more like one of these:
.nf
  fstopgm | pamenlarge 3 | pnmnorm | pamditherbw
  fstopgm | pamenlarge 3 | pamscale <whatever> | pnmnorm | pamditherbw
.fi

You want to enlarge when going to a bitmap because otherwise you lose
information; but enlarging by more than 3 does not look good.
