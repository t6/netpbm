.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBilbmtoppm\fP reads an IFF ILBM file as input and produces a PPM
image as output.  \fBilbmtoppm\fP can handle the following ILBM types:


.IP \(bu
Normal ILBMs with 1-16 planes.
.IP \(bu
Amiga Extra_Halfbrite (EHB)
.IP \(bu
Amiga HAM with 3-16 planes.
.IP \(bu
24 bit.
.IP \(bu
Multiplatte (normal or HAM) pictures.
.IP \(bu
Color map (BMHD + CMAP chunk only, nPlanes = 0).
.IP \(bu
Unofficial direct color.  1-16 planes for each color component.

.PP
\fBilbmtoppm\fP uses these ILBM chunks: BMHD, CMAP, CAMG (only HAM
& EHB flags used), PCHG, BODY unofficial DCOL chunk to identify
direct color ILBM.  It ignores these chunks: GRAB, DEST, SPRT, CRNG,
CCRT, CLUT, DPPV, DRNG, EPSF.  It ignores, but displays in verbose
mode, these: NAME, AUTH, (c), ANNO, DPI.  It skips chunks whose type
it doesn't recognize.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-transparent \fP\fIcolor\fP
This is the color that should "show through" in places where
the image is transparent.
.sp
\fIcolor\fP is like the 
.UR libnetpbm_image.html#colorname
argument of the \fBpnm_parsecolor()\fP library routine
.UE
\&.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Give some information about the ILBM file.

.TP
\fB-ignore\fP \fIchunkID\fP
Skip a chunk.  \fIchunkID\fP is the 4-letter IFF chunk identifier
of the chunk to be skipped.

.TP
\fB-isham\fP | \fB-isehb\fP
Treat the input file as a HAM or Extra_Halfbrite picture, even if
these flags are not set in the CAMG chunk (or if there is no CAMG
chunk).

.TP
\fB-maskfile\fP \fIfilename\fP
This names a file for \fBilbmtoppm\fP to create with the image's
transparency mask.  The mask file is a PBM image which maps to the input image
with white pixels representing transparent pixels in the image and black
pixels representing opaque pixels.
.sp
If you don't specfy this, or the image does not contain transparency
information, \fBilbmtoppm\fP does not create a mask file.

.TP
\fB-cmaponly\fP
With this option, \fBilbmtoppm\fP generates a PPM of the ILBM's \fIcolor
map\fP, not the image itself.
.sp
\fBilbmtoppm\fP does the same thing even without \fB-cmaponly\fP if the
ILBM is a pure color map stream (it has a bitmap header with an \fInplanes\fP
value of zero or has no BODY chunk.

.TP
\fB-adjustcolors\fP
If all colors in the CMAP have a value of less then 16, ilbmtoppm
assumes a 4-bit colormap and gives a warning.  With this option the
colormap is scaled to 8 bits.
