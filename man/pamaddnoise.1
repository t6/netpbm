.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamaddnoise\fP adds the specified noise type to a Netpbm image.
\fBpamaddnoise\fP treats a PPM image as 3 independent planes, not as
a plane of colors in a color space.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-lambda\fP \fIvalue\fP
Used for poisson noise only.  The default value is 0.05.

.TP
\fB-lsigma\fP \fIvalue\fP
Used for laplacian noise only.  The default value is 10.0.

.TP
\fB-mgsigma\fP \fIvalue\fP
Used for multiplicative gaussian noise only.  The default value is
0.5.

.TP
\fB-seed\fP \fIint\fP
Used for all noise types.  Set the initial random number generator
seed value.

.TP
\fB-sigma1\fP \fIvalue\fP
Used for gaussian noise only.  The default value is 4.0.

.TP
\fB-sigma2\fP \fIvalue\fP
Used for gaussian noise only.  The default value is 20.0.

.TP
\fB-tolerance\fP \fIratio\fP
Used for impulse noise only.  The default value is 0.10.  This means
that 5% of all pixel values will be set to 0 and 5% will be set to
the maxval

.TP
\fB-type\fP \fInoise_type\fP
Select type of noise by name.  The following noise types are
available: gaussian, multiplicative_gaussian, impulse, laplacian,
poisson.  Only enough letters to be unique are required for the noise
type option.  The default noise type is \fBgaussian\fP.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamaddnoise\fP was added to Netpbm in Version 10.29 (August 2005).
It had been distributed by Mike Burns via his own web site before that
(and continued to be so).
.PP
Burns' version, and the one in Netpbm 10.29, was called \fBpnmaddnoise\fP
and worked only on PNM images.  In Netpbm 10.30, it was converted to handle
PAM images and renamed to \fBpamaddnoise\fP.
