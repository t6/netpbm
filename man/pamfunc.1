.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamfunc\fP reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a Netpbm
image as output, with the same format, and dimensions as the
input.  \fBpamfunc\fP applies a simple transfer function to each
sample in the input to generate the corresponding sample in the
output.  The options determine what function.
.PP
\fBpamarith\fP is the same thing for binary functions -- it takes
two images as input and applies a specified simple arithmetic function
(e.g. addition) on pairs of samples from the two to produce the single
output image.


.UN values
.SS Values
.PP
The functions fall into two categories: arithmetic (such as multiply by 5)
and bit string (such as and with 01001000).  For the arithmetic functions, the
function arguments and results are the fraction that a sample is of the
maxval, i.e. normal interpretation of PAM tuples.  But for the bit string
functions, the value is the the bit string whose value as a binary cipher is
the sample value, and the maxval indicates the width of the bit string.

.B Arithmetic functions
.PP
The arithmetic functions are those selected by the options
\fB-multiplier\fP, \fB-divisor\fP, \fB-adder\fP, \fB-subtractor\fP,
\fB-min\fP, and \fB-max\fP.
.PP
As an example, consider an image with maxval 100 and a sample value of 10
and a function of "multiply by 5." The argument to the function is
10/100 (0.1) and the result is 5 * 0.1 = 0.5.  In the simplest case, the
maxval of the output is also 100, so the output sample value is 0.5 * 100 =
50.  As you can see, we could just talk about the sample values themselves
instead of these fractions and get the same result (10 * 5 = 50), but we
don't.
.PP
Where it makes a practical difference whether we consider the values to be
the fraction of the maxval or the sample value alone is where \fBpamfunc\fP
uses a different maxval in the output image than it finds in the input
image.  See \fB-changemaxval\fP.
.PP
So remember in reading the descriptions below that the values are 0.1 and
0.5 in this example, not 10 and 50.  All arguments and results are in the
range [0,1].

.B Bit string functions
.PP
The bit string functions are those selected by the options
\fB-andmask\fP, \fB-ormask\fP, \fB-xormask\fP, \fB-not\fP,
\fB-shiftleft\fP, and \fB-shiftright\fP.
.PP
With these functions, the maxval has a very different meaning than in
normal Netpbm images: it tells how wide (how many bits) the bit string is.
The maxval must be a full binary count (a power of two minus one, such as
0xff) and the number of ones in it is the width of the bit string.
.PP
As an example, consider an image with maxval 15 and a sample value of 5
and a function of "and with 0100".  The argument to the function is
0101 and the result is 0100.
.PP
In this example, it doesn't make any practical difference what we consider
the width of the string to be, as long as it is at least 3.  If the maxval
were 255, the result would be the same.  But with a bit shift operation,
it matters.  Consider shifting left by 2 bits.  In the example, where
the input value is 0101, the result is 0100.  But if the maxval were 255,
the result would be 00010100.
.PP
For a masking function, the mask value you specify must not have
more significant bits than the width indicated by the maxval.
.PP
For a shifting operation, the shift count you specify must not be
greater than the width indicated by the maxval.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-multiplier=\fIrealnum\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of multiplying by
     \fIrealnum\fP.  \fIrealnum\fP must be nonnegative.  If the result
     is greater than one, it is clipped to one.
.sp
Where the input is a PGM or PPM image, this has the effect of
     dimming or brightening it.  For a different kind of brightening,
     see
.BR "\fBppmbrighten\fP" (1)\c
\& and
.BR "\fBppmflash\fP" (1)\c
\&
.sp
Also, see
.BR "\fBppmdim\fP" (1)\c
\&, which does the same
     thing as \fBpamfunc -multiplier\fP on a PPM image with a multiplier
     between zero and one, except it uses integer arithmetic, so it may be
     faster.
.sp
And
.BR "\fBppmfade\fP" (1)\c
\& can generate a whole
     sequence of images of brightness declining to black or increasing to
     white, if that's what you want.
     
.TP
\fB-divisor=\fIrealnum\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of dividing by
     \fIrealnum\fP.  \fIrealnum\fP must be nonnegative.  If the result
     is greater than one, it is clipped to one.
.sp
This is the same function as you would get with \fB-multiplier\fP,
     specifying the multiplicative inverse of \fIrealnum\fP.
     
.TP
\fB-adder=\fIinteger\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of adding
     \fIinteger\fP/\fImaxval\fP.  If the result is greater than one, it is
     clipped to one.  If it is less than zero, it is clipped to zero.
.sp
Note that in mathematics, this entity is called an "addend,"
     and an "adder" is a snake.  We use "adder" because
     it makes more sense.
     
.TP
\fB-subtractor=\fIinteger\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of subtracting
     \fIinteger\fP/\fImaxval\fP.  If the result is greater than one, it is
     clipped to one.  If it is less than zero, it is clipped to zero.
.sp
Note that in mathematics, this entity is called a
     "subtrahend" rather than a "subtractor." We use
     "subtractor" because it makes more sense.
.sp
This is the same function as you would get with \fB-adder\fP,
     specifying the negative of \fIinteger\fP.
     
.TP
\fB-min=\fIwholenum\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of taking the maximum of
     the argument and \fIwholenum\fP/\fImaxval\fP.  I.e the minimum value in
     the output will be \fIwholenum\fP/\fImaxval\fP.

     If \fIwholenum\fP/\fImaxval\fP is greater than one, though, every value
     in the output will be one.

.TP
\fB-max=\fIwholenum\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of taking the minimum of
     the argument and \fIwholenum\fP/\fImaxval\fP.  I.e the maximum value in
     the output will be \fIwholenum\fP/\fImaxval\fP.

     If \fIwholenum\fP/\fImaxval\fP is greater than one, the function is
     idempotent -- the output is identical to the input.
     
.TP
\fB-andmask=\fIhexmask\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise anding
     with \fIhexmask\fP.
.sp
\fIhexmask\fP is in hexadecimal.  Example: \f(CW0f\fP
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007).

.TP
\fB-ormask=\fIhexmask\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
     inclusive oring with \fIhexmask\fP.
.sp
This is analogous to \fB-andmask\fP.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007).

.TP
\fB-xormask=\fIhexmask\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
     exclusive oring with \fIhexmask\fP.
.sp
This is analogous to \fB-andmask\fP.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007).

.TP
\fB-not\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise logical
     inversion (e.g. sample value 0xAA becomes 0x55).
.sp
\fBpnminvert\fP does the same thing for a bilevel visual image
     which has maxval 1 or is of PBM type.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007).

.TP
\fB-shiftleft=\fIcount\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise shifting
     left by \fIcount\fP bits.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007).

.TP
\fB-shiftright=\fIcount\fP\fP
.sp
This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise shifting
     right by \fIcount\fP bits.
.sp
This is analogous to \fB-shiftleft\fP.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007).

.TP
\fB-changemaxval\fP
.sp
This option tells \fBpamfunc\fP to use a different maxval in the output
image than the maxval of the input image, if it helps.  By default, the maxval
of the output is unchanged from the input and \fBpamfunc\fP modifies the
sample values as necessary to perform the operation.
.sp
But there is one case where \fBpamfunc\fP can achieve the same result just
by changing the maxval and leaving the sample values unchanged: dividing by a
number 1 or greater, or multiplying by a number 1 or less.  For example, to
halve all of the values, \fBpamfunc\fP can just double the maxval.
.sp
With \fB-changemaxval\fP, \fBpamfunc\fP will do just that.
.sp
As the Netpbm formats have a maximum maxval of 65535, for large divisors,
\fBpamfunc\fP may not be able to use this method.
.sp
An advantage of dividing by changing the maxval is that you don't lose
precision.  The higher maxval means higher precision.  For example, consider
an image with a maxval of 100 and sample value of 10.  You divide by 21 and
then multiply by 21 again.  If \fBpamfunc\fP does this by changing the sample
values while retaining maxval 100, the division will result in a sample value
of 0 and the multiplication will also result in zero.  But if \fBpamfunc\fP
instead keeps the sample value 10 and changes the maxval, the division will
result in a maxval of 2100 and the multiplication will change it back to 100,
and the round trip is idempotent.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.65 (December 2013).
