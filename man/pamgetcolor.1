.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamgetcolor\fP prints the average colors of a set of circular
regions in the input image.
.PP
You specify a region as a positional argument of the form
\fIcolumn\fP,\fIrow\fP[:\fIlabel\fP], where \fIcolumn\fP and \fIrow\fP
are the coordinates of the center of the circle (first row of pixels is row 0;
leftmost column of pixels is column 0), and \fIlabel\fP an optional label
that \fBpamgetcolor\fP shall display to identify that region in its output.
All regions have he same radius, specified by the \fB-radius\fP option.  The
region centers must lie within the image, but part of a region may fall
outside the image; \fBpamgetcolor\fP considers only the part that is within
the image in calculations.


.UN examples
.SH EXAMPLES

To read the color of the pixel at location (10,14) in the default
format:

.nf
\f(CW
    pamgetcolor 10,14 -infile test.ppm
\fP
.fi
.PP
To read the colors of three pixels in the default format, assigning a
label to each pixel:
  
.nf
\f(CW
    pamgetcolor 10,10:topleft 100,100:middle 200,200:bottomright -infile test.ppm
\fP
.fi
.PP
To read with 16-bit precision the average color in the circle with a radius
of four pixels and the center at (100,100):

.nf
\f(CW
    pamgetcolor -format int:65535 -radius 4 100,100 -infile test.ppm
\fP
.fi

.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-format\fP
This specifies the format in which to output the colors.  The output is
always a 
.UR libppm.html#colorname
Netpbm color specification
.UE
\&; this
format tells which of the various specifications for the same color the
program uses.
.sp
This argument is of the form \fIformatId\fP[:\fIparam\fP], where
\fIformatId\fP specifies the format and \fIparam\fP is a positive
integer parameter that, depending on \fIformatId\fP, indicates
either precision or normalization. The following values are possible for
\fIformatId\fP:

.TP
\f(CWint\fP
Samples are decimal integers normalized to the maxval specified by
\fIparam\fP.  Example: \fBrgb-255:255/128/64\fP
This format is the default, with a maxval of 255.
.TP
\f(CWnorm\fP
Samples are floating point numbers normalized to unity.  E.g.
\fBrgbi:1.0/0.5/.25\fP
\fIparam\fP specifies precision as the number of digits in the
fractional part.
.TP
\f(CWx11\fP
Samples are hexadecimal numbers with \fIparam\fP digits,
e.g. \fBrgb:01/ff/8000\fP


.TP
\fB-radius\fP
sets the radius of the regions.
A value of zero causes \fBpamgetcolor\fP to measure a single pixel and
is the default.

.TP
\fB-infile\fP
This specifies the Netpbm file to analyze.
.sp
If you don't specify this option, \fBpamgetcolor\fP reads the image from
Standard Input.

.TP
\fB-linear\fP
This tells \fBpamgetcolor\fP to work with the intensity-linear variation
of Netpbm images where the samples are proportional to light intensity rather
than to brightness, as in true (gamma-adjusted) Netpbm formats.
