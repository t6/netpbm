.SH NAME

pampick - pick images out of a multi-image Netpbm image stream

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpampick\fP

\fIimage_sequence_number\fP ...
.PP
Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use white
space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from its value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpampick\fP reads a PNM or PAM image stream as input.  It
picks certain images from the stream and copies them to a new image
stream on Standard Output.
.PP
You identify the images to pick by sequence number within the stream.
Each \fIimage_sequence_number\fP is a decimal sequence number, with zero
meaning the first image.
.PP
The arguments must be in increasing order, without duplicates.  The
results are undefined if they are not.  (There are a number of
enhancements that might be made in future releases that would make
whatever \fBpampick\fP does today when you break this rule change).
\fBpampick\fP outputs the images in the same order as they appear in
the input.  If you specify no sequence numbers, \fBpampick\fP outputs
nothing.  If you specify a sequence number that is beyond what is in
the input, \fBpampick\fP fails with an error message to that effect.
.PP
\fBpampick\fP always reads the entire input stream.  (This is helpful
when the input stream is a pipe and whatever is feeding the pipe would be
upset if it filled up or broke).
.PP
To see how many images, and what kind, are in a stream, use
\fBpamfile\fP.
.PP
To extract all the images in a stream into separate named files,
use \fBpamsplit\fP.
