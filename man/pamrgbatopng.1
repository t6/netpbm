.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamrgbatopng\fP was obsoleted by
.BR "\fBpamtopng\fP" (1)\c
\&, introduced with Netpbm 10.70
(June 2015).  \fBpamtopng\fP is backward compatible with
\fBpamrgbatopng\fP, plus adds a plethora additional functions.
.PP
Starting in Release 10.70, \fBpamrgbatopng\fP is just an alias for
\fBpamtopng\fP.
.PP
\fBpamrgbatopng\fP was added to Netpbm in 2005, and was always expected to
be retired eventually because it had almost no features, compared to the more
popular and much older \fBpnmtopng\fP.  It had, in fact, no command line
options.  But the one feature it had that \fBpnmtopng\fP lacked was the
ability to recognize transparency in a PAM image.  \fBpamtopng\fP has that,
as well as most of the features of \fBpnmtopng\fP.
