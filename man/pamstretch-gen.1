.SH NAME

pamstretch-gen - use pamstretch and pamscale to scale by non-integer values

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamstretch-gen\fP \fIN\fP [\fIpnmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.

\fBpamstretch-gen\fP is a program which uses
.BR "pamstretch" (1)\c
\&,
.BR "pnmfile" (1)\c
\&, and
.BR "pamscale" (1)\c
\& to smoothly scale up a PNM file
by any ratio; it's like a more general version of pamstretch (hence
the name). But other than the `any ratio' bit, it's much the same as
pamstretch. :-)


.UN lbAE
.SH LIMITATIONS

The program uses \fBawk\fP just to make some simple floating-point
calculations, which is probably overkill.  But using \fBdc\fP makes
my head hurt.
