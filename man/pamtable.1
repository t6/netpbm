.SH NAME

pamtable - print the raster as a table of numerical sample values

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamtable\fP

[\fInetpbmfile\fP]


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamtable\fP prints the raster of a Netpbm image as a table of numerical
sample values.  For example, a 5-pixel wide, 2-pixel high rainbow (black, red,
green, blue, white) PPM image with maxval 255 would appear as follows:

.nf
\f(CW

        0   0   0|255   0   0|  0 255   0|  0   0 255|255 255 255
        0   0   0|255   0   0|  0 255   0|  0   0 255|255 255 255

\fP
.fi
.PP
If you care to see only certain rows or columns, use \fBpamcut\fP to
filter the input.
.PP
If you care to see only certain planes, use \fBpamchannel\fP to filter the
input.
.PP
\fBpamtable\fP prints vertical bars between tuples, unless there is only
one sample per tuple, in which case it prints a single space between tuples.
.PP
\fBpamtable\fP prints a single space between samples within a tuple.
.PP
For each sample, \fBpamtable\fP prints the numerical value from the Netpbm
image, uninterpreted.  It prints it in decimal, right justified in the minimum
number of spaces required to print the maxval of the image.
.PP
If you want the samples to print more densely, use \fBpamdepth\fP to
reduce the maxval (thus making the decimal numbers for the samples narrower).
.PP
The \fBless\fP program (not part of Netpbm) is good for browsing through
the table.  Use its \fB--chop-long-lines\fP option and use cursor movement
keys to scroll around in the image.


.UN arguments
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
The only possible argument is the name of the file containing the input
Netpbm image.  This is optional; if you don't specify any arguments, the input
comes from Standard Input.


.UN options

None.
