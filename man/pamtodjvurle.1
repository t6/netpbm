.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamtodjvurle\fP was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004) but a
program that did almost the same thing, called \fBppmtodjvurle\fP,
was in Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).  The latter was written and
contributed to Netpbm by Scott Pakin <scott+pbm@pakin.org>.
\fBpamtodjvurle\fP uses techniques taken from \fBppmtodjvurle\fP,
but no code is copied between them.
