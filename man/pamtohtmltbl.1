double hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name
from its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamtohtmltbl\fP converts a visual image to an HTML table with one
cell per pixel.  The cell is empty, but its background color is that of the
pixel.
.PP
\fIfile\fP is a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM file.  If PAM, it must be
a standard visual image of tuple type RGB, GRAYSCALE, or BLACKANDWHITE, or
something equivalent with extra higher numbered channels, but
\fBpamtohtmltbl\fP doesn't check the tuple type; it just assumes.
.PP
Note that the more normal way to include a visual image in an HTML
document is with a <IMG> tag.
.PP
Not all web browsers render tables as \fBpamtohtmltbl\fP expects,
and therefore show a grossly distorted image.  Internet Explorer 7 on
Windows and Opera 9.02 on Windows have been seen to work; Firefox
2.0.0.16 on the same Windows system has been seen not to.
