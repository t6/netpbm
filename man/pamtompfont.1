.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamtompfont\fP reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and converts it
to an Mplayer bitmap font raster file.
.PP
This is the original font format used by Mplayer (for subtitles,
on-screen messages, etc.), before it had the ability to use Freetype
to access standard fonts.
.PP
The format was apparently an image format before Mplayer adopted it
for fonts, but I have no idea where it came from or where else it might
be used.
.PP
An Mplayer bitmap font consists of a font descriptor file and
raster files.  The font descriptor file identifies the raster files by
file name.  A raster file contains a single rectangular raster image
which contains an arrangement of a bunch of glyphs.  Each glyph is a
rectangular image and the font descriptor indicates where in the image
the glyph for each codepoint is.  Every glyph in the font has the same
height, so the font descriptor just indicates the file position in the
raster file of the to left corner of the glyph, and the width of the
glyph in pixels.
