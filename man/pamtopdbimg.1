.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamtopdbimg\fP reads a Netpbm image as input and produced a Palm Pilot
Image Viewer image (and Image record in a PDB file) as output.
.PP
If the Netpbm image is black and white, the Pilot image is monochrome.
Otherwise, the Pilot image is either 4-level or 16-level grayscale, depending
on the \fB-4depth\fP option.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-title=\fP\fItext\fP
The title of the image, to be included in the image.

.TP
\fB-compressed\fP
.TP
\fB-uncompressed\fP
.TP
\fB-maybecompressed\fP
You may specify only one of these.
\fB-compressed\fP says to generate the image in compressed format.
\fB-uncompressed\fP says to generate the image in uncompressed format.
\fB-maybecompressed\fP says to generate whichever format is smaller
(the compression algorithm sometimes actually makes the data larger).

.TP
\fB-4depth\fP
This option makes \fBpamtopdbimg\fP create the image in 16-level
grayscale (4 bits per pixel) format.  If you don't specify this,
\fBpamtopdbimg\fP uses 4-level (2 bits per pixel) format.
.sp
This option has no effect when the input is black and white
(maxval 1).  In that case, \fBpamtopdbimg\fP generates the monochrome
(1 bit per pixel) format regardless.

.TP
\fB-notefile=\fP\fIfilename\fP
Attach the note in the specified file to the image.
.sp
If you don't specify this, \fBpamtopdbimg\fP does not attach any note.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamtopdbimg\fP was new in Netpbm 10.52 (September 2010).
It was modelled after Eric A. Howe's \fBimgvtopbm\fP package, which
dates back to September 1997.
