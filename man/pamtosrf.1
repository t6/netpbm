[\fInetpbmfile\fP]


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamtosrf\fP reads a Netpbm image stream as input and produces a
an SRF image file as output.  I don't know exactly what SRF is, but on popular
use of it is in Garmin vehicle information files, which tell a GPS receiver
how to depict a vehicle on its display.
.PP
An SRF file can contain multiple images; each image in a multi-image
Netpbm input stream becomes one image in the SRF.
.PP
\fBpamtosrf\fP does not care how many images there are or what their
dimensions or content are.  However, a Garmin vehicle information file has
specific requirements, so if you don't make your Netpbm input conform, neither
will your SRF output.  For such a file, you should have two image: the first
for 3D oblique views of the vehicle and the second for overhead views.  Each
image is a horizontal concatenation of 36 square images, each rotated 10
degrees from the previous, thereby covering the full 360 degree circle.
You could create this concatenation with \fBpnmcat -lr\fP and you could
create the invidual views with \fBpnmrotate\fP.

.PP
One way to use \fBpamtosrf\fP is to get an SRF file, convert it to PAM
with \fBsrftopam\fP, manipulate it, then convert it back with
\fBpamtosrf\fP.
.PP
\fInetpbmfile\fP is the input stream, which defaults to Standard Input.
Output is always on Standard Output.
