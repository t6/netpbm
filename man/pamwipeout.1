pamwipeout - replace detail with smooth gradient from one edge to the other

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpamwipeout\fP

.PP
Minimum unique abbreviation of options is acceptable. 
You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
The \fBpamwipeout\fP utility takes a Netpbm image as input and the uses
two opposite edges of the image to wipe out anything in between.  You can use
it in combination with \fBpamcut\fP and \fBpnmpaste\fP / \fBpamcomp\fP to
remove unwanted parts of a larger image.  The program replaces the pixels in
between the two edges with a gradient from one edge to the other.
.PP
In \fBtop-bottom\fP mode, the program reads the whole image into memory
before it can start processing.  In \fBleft-right\fP it will read the image a
row at the time, process that row and write it to the output file.  Therefore,
in case of very large images, it may be better to use instead of
"\fBpamwipeout -tb\fP" a pipe of "\fBpamflip -cw | pamwipeout -lr | pamflip
-ccw\fP".

the author wrote about a predecessor of "pamwipeout" at the time named
"pnmblend". It shows a good example of what can be accomplished with this
utility.
