.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpbmtextps\fP takes a single line of text from the command line and
renders it into a PBM image.  The image is of a single line of text; newline
characters in the input have no effect.
.PP
See \fBpbmtext\fP for a more sophisticated generator of text, but using
less common font formats.  \fBpbmtext\fP can generate multiple lines of text.
.PP
The \fB-plain\fP 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
common option
.UE
\& has
no effect before Netpbm 10.42 (March 2008).  The output is always raw PBM.

.UN margins
.SS Margins
.PP
By default, the image is cropped at the top and the right.  It is not
cropped at the left or bottom so that the text begins at the same position
relative to the origin.  The size of the default left and bottom margins is
explained below.
.PP
You can set whatever margin you want with options
\fB-leftmargin\fP, \fB-rightmargin\fP, \fB-topmargin\fP and
\fB-bottommargin\fP.  The specified amount of white space gets added to the
far edge of type, e.g. if you specify 10 points for \fB-topmargin\fP, you
will get 10 points of white space above the highest character on the line.
Specify 0 to crop a side.
.PP
\fB-ascent\fP adds white space to the top to reach a specified distance
above the text baseline, and \fB-descent\fP adds white space to to the bottom
to reach a specified distance below the text baseline.
.PP
\fB-ascent\fP and \fB-descent\fP are more useful than \fB-topmargin\fP
and \fB-bottomargin\fP when you render two pieces of text (in separate
invocations of \fBpbmtextps\fP) that you will concatenate horizontally.
With \fB-ascent\fP and \fB-descent\fP, the two images will be the same
height with the text baseline in the same place.  With \fB-topmargin\fP
and \fB-bottommargin\fP, that may not be the case.
.PP
Example:

.nf
\f(CW
     $ pbmtextps -font=Times-Roman -descent=20 \e
          'The soup is called' > a1.pbm
     $ pbmtextps -font=Itallic -descent=20 'Goulash.' > a2.pbm
     $ pnmcat -lr -jb a1.pbm a2.pbm > out.pbm
\fP
.fi
.PP
If you have \fB-ascent\fP, there is probably no point in specifying
\fB-topmargin\fP too, but if you do, the effect is cumulative.  The same is
true of \fB-descent\fP and \fB-bottommargin\fP.
.PP
\fB-pad\fP pads the image on the top and bottom to the where the highest
and lowest characters in the font would reach, even if you don't have those
characters in your text.  This is useful if you will generate multiple images
of text (with multiple invocations of \fBpbmtextps\fP and concatenate them
vertically to create a multiline text image.  \fB-pad\fP makes sure the lines
in this image are equally spaced.
.PP
Example:

.nf
\f(CW
    $ pbmtextps 'cat'   | pamfile
    $ pbmtextps 'Catty' | pamfile
\fP
.fi
.PP
The commands above, with no \fB-pad\fP, show that the 'Catty'
image is higher because capital C reaches high and 'y' reaches low.

.nf
\f(CW
    $ pbmtextps -pad 'cat'   | pamfile
    $ pbmtextps -pad 'Catty' | pamfile
\fP
.fi
.PP
The commands above, with \fB-pad\fP, show that both images are the same
height.
.PP
If you specify \fB-pad\fP with \fB-ascent\fP or \fB-descent\fP, the
larger value is effective.
.PP
\fB-crop\fP makes the program crop all sides to the far edge of the type.
It is the same as \f(CW-leftmargin=0 -rightmargin=0 -topmargin=0
-bottommargin=0\fP.
.PP
You cannot specify any other margin-affecting options with \fB-crop\fP.
.PP
The default top margin, when you specify neither \fB-ascent\fP,
\fB-topmargin\fP, nor \fB-pad\fP, is as if you specified
\fBtopmargin=0\fP.
.PP
The default bottom margin, when you specify neither \fB-descent\fP,
\fB-bottommargin\fP, nor \fB-pad\fP, is as if you specified
\fB-descent=\fP\fI1.5*fontsize\fP.
.PP
The default left margin, when you do not specify \fB-leftmargin\fP, is
as if you specified \fB-leftmargin=\fP\fI0.5*fontsize\fP.
.PP
The default right margin, when you do not specify \fB-rightmargin\fP,
is as if you specified \fB-rightmargin=0\fP.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-font=\fP\fIfontname\fP
.sp
This specifies the font to use.  \fIfontname\fP is the name of any valid
postscript font which is installed on the system.
.sp
The default is \fBTimesRoman\fP.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP if \fIfontname\fP does not name a valid font,
\fBpbmtextps\fP just uses the default font.  It does not tell you it is doing
this.

.TP
\fB-fontsize=\fP\fIfloat\fP
This is the size of the font in points.  See the \fB-resolution\fP option for
information on how to interpret this size.
.sp
The default is 24 points.
.sp
Before Netpbm 10.75 (June 2016), this has to be a whole number.

.TP
\fB-resolution=\fP\fIn\fP
This is the resolution in dots per inch of distance measurements pertaining to
generation of the image.  PBM images don't have any inherent resolution, so a
distance such as "1 inch" doesn't mean anything unless you separately specify
what resolution you're talking about.  That's what this option does.
.sp
In particular, the meaning of the font size is determined by this
resolution.  If the font size is 24 points and the resolution is 150 dpi, then
the font size is 50 pixels.
.sp
The default is 150 dpi.

.TP
\fB-leftmargin=\fP\fIn\fP
.TP
\fB-rightmargin=\fP\fIn\fP
.TP
\fB-topmargin=\fP\fIn\fP
.TP
\fB-bottommargin=\fP\fIn\fP
These options control the margins added to the image, measured from the far
edge of the type.  See 
.UR #margins
Margins
.UE
\& for details.
.sp
All sizes are in points, as a floating point number.
.sp
These options were new in Netpbm 10.75 (June 2016).

.TP
\fB-ascent=\fP\fIn\fP
.TP
\fB-descent=\fP\fIn\fP
These options control the the margins added to the image, measured from
the text baseline.  See 
.UR #margins
Margins
.UE
\& for details.
.sp
Sizes are in points, as a floating point number.
.sp
These options were new in Netpbm 10.75 (June 2016).

.TP
\fB-pad\fP
This pads the image on the top and bottom to the where the highest and lowest
characters in the font would reach, even if you don't have those characters in
your text.  See 
.UR #margins
Margins
.UE
\& for details.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.75 (June 2016).

.TP
\fB-crop\fP
This makes the program crop all sides to the far edge of the type.  It is the
same as \f(CW-leftmargin=0 -rightmargin=0 -topmargin=0 -bottommargin=0\fP.
See 
.UR #margins
Margins
.UE
\& for details.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.75 (June 2016).

.TP
\fB-stroke=\fP\fIn\fP
This is the width of line, in points, to use for stroke font.  There is no
default stroke width because the characters are solid by default.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
This option makes \fBpbmtextps\fP display extra information on Standard Error
about its processing.

.TP
\fB-dump-ps\fP
This option makes \fBpbmtextps\fP write to Standard Output the Postscript
program it would use to create the image, rather than the image itself.  You
can use this as input to a Postscript interpreter (such as Ghostscript or a a
printer) or to understand the program better.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.75 (June 2016).



.UN usage
.SH USAGE

You can generate antialiased text by using a larger resolution than the
default and scaling the image down using \fBpamscale\fP.
.PP
See the manual for the similar \fBpbmtext\fP for more advice on
usage.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpbmtextps\fP was added to Netpbm in Release 10.0 (June 2002).
