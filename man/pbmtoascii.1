.SH NAME

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtoascii\fP

[\fB-1x2\fP|\fB-2x4\fP]

[\fIpbmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpbmtoascii\fP reads a PBM image as input and produces a somewhat
crude ASCII graphic image as output.
.PP
To convert back, use
.BR "asciitopgm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBppmtoterm\fP does a similar thing for color images to be displayed
on color text terminals.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The \fB-1x2\fP and \fB-2x4\fP options give you two alternate ways for the
pixels to get mapped to characters.  With \fB1x2\fP, the default, each
character represents a group of 1 pixel across by 2 pixels down.  With
\fB-2x4\fP, each character represents 2 pixels across by 4 pixels down.  With
the 1x2 mode you can see the individual pixels, so it's useful for previewing
small images on a non-graphics terminal.  The 2x4 mode lets you display larger
images on a small display, but it obscures pixel-level details.  2x4 mode is
also good for displaying PGM images:

.nf
pamscale -width 158 | pnmnorm | pamditherbw -threshold | pbmtoascii -2x4
.fi

should give good results.
