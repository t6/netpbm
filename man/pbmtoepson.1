.SH NAME
pbmtoepson - convert a PBM image into Epson printer graphics

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtoepson\fP

[\fB-dpi=\fP\fIn\fP]
[\fB-protocol=\fP{\fBescp9\fP|\fBescp\fP}]
[\fB-adjacent\fP]
[\fB-nonadjacent\fP]

[\fIpbmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.

\fBpbmtoepson\fP reads a PBM image as input and produces a stream of
Epson printer graphics as output.
.PP
The input is from the file identified by the \fIpbmfile\fP argument
or, if you don't specify \fIpbmfile\fP, from Standard Input.  Output is
to Standard Output.
.PP
The output is for traditional (ca 1991) Epson 9-wire dot matrix
(sometimes called ESC/P 9-wire) printers or newer ESC/P printers.  For
a more modern Epson ESC/P2 type printer, try \fBpbmtoescp2\fP.
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), \fBpbmtoepson\fP could not produce
ESC/P streams -- only ESC/P 9-wire.
.PP
The Epson printer protocols are described in Epson's protocol
specification.
.PP
Note that there is no epsontopbm tool - this transformation is one way.

.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-protocol=\fP{\fBescp9\fP|\fBescp\fP}
This determines which Epson printer protocol the output uses.
\fBescp9\fP is the older ESC/P 9-pin protocol.  \fBescp\fP is the
newer ESC/P protocol.  For the even newer \fBESC/P2\fP protocol, you
have to use \fBpbmtoescp2\fP instead.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).     


.TP
\fB-dpi=\fP\fIn\fP
This specifies the horizontal print density in dots per inch.  The
protocol allows only certain values: 60, 72, 80, 90, 120, 144, and 240.
Actually, the ESC/P protocol allows a few others, but \fBpbmtoepson\fP
doesn't know how to generate the command streams that use them.
.sp
If you don't specify this, \fBpbmtoepson\fP chooses a horizontal
print density for you consistent with your other options.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).     

.TP
\fB-adjacent\fP
.TP
\fB-nonadjacent\fP
These options determine whether the output uses "adjacent dot
printing" or not, whatever that is.
.sp
If you don't specify this, \fBpbmtoepson\fP selects adjacent dot
printing unless that is incompatible with your other options.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).
