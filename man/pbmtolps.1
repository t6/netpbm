.SH NAME

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtolps\fP
[\fB-dpi\fP=\fIn\fP]
[\fIpbmfile\fP]

Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use
double hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name
from its value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpbmtolps\fP reads a PBM image as input and outputs PostScript.  The
output Postscript uses lines instead of the image operator to generate a
(device dependent) picture which will be imaged much faster.
.PP
\fBpnmtops\fP is a more general program for converting from the Netpbm
formats to Postscript, though it cannot produce the particular arcane
subformat that \fBpbmtolps\fP does.
.PP
One pixel of the input image corresponds to one printed pixel
('dot').  For this to work, you must use a \fB-dpi\fP option to
tell \fBpmtolps\fP the resolution of the target printer, in dots per inch.
  
.PP
The Postscript program \fBpbmtolps\fP generates draws paths of less than
1000 segments so as not to overrun limits on the Apple Laserwriter and
possibly other printers.
