pbmtomacp - convert a PBM image to a MacPaint file

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtomacp\fP
[\fB-left\fP \fIleft\fP]

[\fB-top\fP \fItop\fP]

[\fB-bottom\fP \fIbottom\fP]

[\fIpbmfile\fP]

All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You
may use either white space or equals signs between an option name and
its value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpbmtomacp\fP reads a PBM image as input and produces a MacPaint
file as output.
.PP
If you do not specify \fIpbmfile\fP, \fBpbmtomacp\fP uses Standard Input.
.PP
 The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will
need a program such as \fBmcvert\fP to generate a Macbinary or a
BinHex file that contains the necessary information to identify the
file as a PNTG file to MacOS.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-norle\fP
This option tells \fBpbmtomacp\fP not to use any run length encoding
compression in the MacPaint image it produces.  This output, while not
normal, conforms to MacPaint specifications and can be read by any
MacPaint decoder without any special settings.
.sp
The only value of this option is testing and experimentation.  The option
causes every output image to contain exactly 53072 bytes, which is the
theoretical maximum size for a MacPaint image.
.sp
Without \fB-norle\fP, MacPaint compresses the image as much as possible
and the output size depends on the nature of the input.

.TP
\fB-left\fP
\fB-right\fP
\fB-top\fP
\fB-bottom\fP
These options let you define a rectangle within the image to convert.  The
default is the whole file.  If the specified image is too large for a
MacPaint-file, \fBpbmtomacp\fP cuts the image to fit, starting at the
specified top left corner.
.sp
These options exist for backward compatibility with an unfortunate original
design.  They do the same thing that you can do in a more Netpbm-like way and
more flexibly by processing the input through \fBpamcut\fP.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpbmtomacp\fP was added to Netpbm in 1988, written by Douwe van der
Schaaf (...!mcvax!uvapsy!vdschaaf).
.PP
In 2015, Akira Urushibata ("Douso") replaced the program with
the current version, using different logic and none of the original code.
The new version used the "packed PBM" facilities of the Netpbm
library and the shhopt method of command line parsing.
