[\fB--dpi=\fP\fIdpi\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpbmtopsg3\fP converts the PBM images in the input PBM file to
pages in a Postscript file encoded with G3 fax compression.
.PP
\fBpnmtops\fP is a more general program for converting from the Netpbm
formats to Postscript, though it cannot produce the particular subformat
that \fBpbmtopsg3\fP does.
.PP
If you don't specify \fIfilespec\fP, the input is from Standard
Input.
.PP
Remember that you can create a multi-image PBM file simply by
concatenating single-image PBM files, so if each page is in a
different file, you might do:

.nf
cat faxpage* | pbmtopsg3 >fax.ps
.fi

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-title\fP
The Postscript title value.  Default is no title.
