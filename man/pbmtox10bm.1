.SH NAME
pbmtox10bm - convert a PBM image to an X11 bitmap

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpbmtox10bm\fP was replaced in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) by
.BR "pbmtoxbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpbmtoxbm\fP with the \fB-x10\fP option is backward compatible
with \fBpbmtox10bm\fP.  \fBpbmtoxbm\fP also can generate X11 bitmaps.
.PP
You should not make any new use of \fBpbmtox10bm\fP and if you modify an
existing use, you should upgrade to \fBpbmtoxbm\fP.  But note that if you
write a program that might have to be used with old Netpbm, \fBpbmtox10bm\fP
is the only way to do that.
