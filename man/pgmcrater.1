.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpgmcrater\fP

[\fB-number\fP \fIn\fP]

[\fB-height\fP|\fB-ysize\fP \fIs\fP]

[\fB-width\fP|\fB-xsize\fP \fIs\fP]

[\fB-gamma\fP \fIg\fP]

[\fB-randomseed=\fP\fIinteger\fP]
.PP
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may
use either white space or equals signs between an option name and its
value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpgmcrater\fP is obsolete.  All it does now is invoke
\fBpamcrater\fP, \fBpamshadedrelief\fP, and \fBpamtopnm\fP.  You should use
those programs in any new application, or if you are modifying an old program
or process that does not have to work with a version of Netpbm before 10.68
(September 2014).  \fBpgmcrater\fP exists only for backward compatibility.
.PP
The combination of the three programs mentioned above performs the same
function as traditional \fBpgmcrater\fP.
.PP
\fBpgmcrater\fP's \fB-number\fP, \fB-height\fP, \fB-width\fP,
and \fB-randomseed\fP options are equivalent to the options of the same name
on \fBpamcrater\fP.
.PP
\fBpgmcrater\fP's \fB-gamma\fP option is equivalent to
the option of the same name on \fBpamshadedrelief\fP.
.PP
\fBpgmcrater\fP's \fB-ysize\fP option is identical to \fB-height\fP;
\fB-xsize\fP is identical to \fB-width\fP.
.PP
Note: The former \fBpgmcrater\fP code was split into \fBpamcrater\fP
and \fBpamshadedrelief\fP.  The reason for the split is that having separate
programs is more consistent with Netpbm's building block philosophy.  It is
possible the separate components can be used in other applications.
