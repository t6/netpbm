Minimum unique abbreviations of option are acceptable.  You may use
double hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name
from its value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpgmnoise\fP creates a PGM image that is made up of pixels
of random brightness.
.PP
You specify the dimensions of the image with the \fIwidth\fP
and \fIheight\fP arguments.
.PP
The randomness in the image is limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December
2006) -- if you run the program twice in the same second, you may get
identical output.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-maxval=\fP\fIn\fP
The maxval of the generated image.
.sp
Default is 255.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.63 (June 2013).

.TP
\fB-randomseed=\fP\fIinteger\fP
This is the seed for the random number generator that generates the
pixels.
.sp
Use this to ensure you get the same image on separate invocations.
.sp
By default, \fBpgmnoise\fP uses a seed derived from the time of day
and process ID, which gives you fairly uncorrelated results in multiple
invocations.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.45 (December 2008).
