.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpgmtexture\fP reads a PGM image as input and calculates
textural features based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90,
and 135 degrees for a distance \fId\fP (default = 1).
.PP
Textural features include:


.IP \(bu
Angular Second Moment
.IP \(bu
Contrast
.IP \(bu
Correlation
.IP \(bu
Variance
.IP \(bu
Inverse Difference Moment
.IP \(bu
Sum Average
.IP \(bu

.IP \(bu
Information Measures of Correlation
.IP \(bu
Maximal Correlation Coefficient

.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The method for finding the Maximal Correlation Coefficient, which requires
finding the second largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not always converge.
