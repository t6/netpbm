.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
This program is obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).  Use
.BR "\fBpamditherbw\fP" (1)\c
\& to do what this program
used to do.
.PP
\fBpgmtopbm\fP never was the simple converter it appeared to be.
It was a dithering program.  Unfortunately, it didn't do the dithering
properly because it treated the PGM input samples as if they were
directly proportional to light intensity, but they are actually
gamma-adjusted.
.PP
\fBpamditherbw\fP is backward compatible with \fBpgmtopbm\fP
except that it 

.IP \(bu
does the correct gamma adjustments.
.IP \(bu
produces PAM output instead of PBM.  (Modern Netpbm programs that
accept PBM input also accept PAM input, but if you need actual PBM,
you can use \fBpamtopbm\fP with \fBpamditherbw\fP).

So use the manual for \fBpamditherbw\fP for \fBpgmtopbm\fP, except
ignore anything that says it was added after Netpbm Release 10.23
and ignore any options that are not shown in the synopsis above.
.PP
If you just want to convert a PGM image with maxval 1 to PBM,
use
.BR "\fBpamtopnm\fP" (1)\c
