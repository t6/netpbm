.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpicttoppm\fP reads a PICT file (version 1 or 2) and outputs a PPM
image.
.PP
PICT is an image format that was developed by Apple Computer in 1984 as the
native format for Macintosh graphics.  A PICT image is encoded in QuickDraw
commands.  The PICT format is a meta-format that can be used for both bitmap
images and vector images.  PICT is also known as "Macintosh Picture"
format, or the QuickDraw Picture format.
.PP
PICT files are primarily used to exchange graphics between various
Macintosh applications.
.PP
In MacOS X, PDF replaces PICT as the main graphics format.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-fontdir \fP\fIfile\fP
Make the list of BDF fonts in \fIfile\fP available for use by
\fBpicttoppm\fP when drawing text.  See below for the format of the
fontdir file.  This is in addition to the built-in fonts and those in
the file \fBfontdir\fP.

.TP
\fB-fullres\fP
Force any images in the PICT file to be output with at least their
full resolution.  A PICT file may indicate that a contained
image is to be scaled down before output.  This option forces images
to retain their sizes and prevent information loss.
This option disables all PICT operations except images.

.TP
\fB-noheader\fP
Do not assume the first 512 bytes of the file are a header.  All PICT
files have such a header, but this is useful when you have PICT data that was
not stored in the data fork of a PICT file.

.TP
\fB-quickdraw\fP
Execute only pure quickdraw operations.  In particular, turn off
the interpretation of special PostScript printer operations.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print a whole bunch of information about the PICT file and the
conversion process that only \fBpicttoppm\fP hackers really care
about.



.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS

The PICT file format is a general drawing format.  \fBpicttoppm\fP
does not recognize all the drawing commands, but it does fully
implement all image commands and mostly implement line, rectangle,
polygon and text drawing.  It is useful for converting scanned images
and some drawing conversion.
.PP
With \fB-fullres\fP, \fBpicttoppm\fP ignores text drawing commands.
Beginning in Netpbm 10.45 (December 2008), it issues a warning message
when it omits text for this reason.

.UN fonts
.SH FONTS
.PP
Some of the information in a PICT file is text, with a number
indicating the font in which the text is supposed to rendered.
\fBpicttoppm\fP has one built-in font, but you can add others by
directing \fBpicttoppm\fP to BDF font files, which you do with font
directory files.
.PP
\fBpicttoppm\fP automatically uses the file named \fBfontdir\fP
in the current directory, if it exists.  You may specify an additional
font directory file with the \fB-fontdir\fP option.
.PP
Obviously the font definitions are strongly related to the
Macintosh.  You can find more font numbers and information about fonts
in Macintosh documentation.

.UN fontdir
.SS FONT DIR FILE FORMAT
.PP
Each line in the file is either a comment or font information.  A
comment begins with \fB#\fP.  The font information consists of 4
whitespace separated fields.  The first is the font number, the second
is the font size in pixels, the third is the font style and the fourth
is the name of a BDF file containing the font.  The BDF format is
defined by the X Window System and is beyond the scope of this document.
.PP
The font number indicates the type face.  Here is a list of known
font numbers and their faces.

The font style indicates a variation on the font.  Multiple
variations may apply to a font and the font style is the sum of the
variation numbers which are:
