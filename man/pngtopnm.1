.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpngtopnm\fP was obsoleted by
.BR "\fBpngtopam\fP" (1)\c
\&, introduced with Netpbm 10.44
(September 2008).  \fBpngtopam\fP is backward compatible with
\fBpngtopnm\fP, plus adds many additional functions, including the
ability to produce a PAM image that includes a transparency (alpha)
channel.

Starting in Release 10.48, \fBpngtopnm\fP is just an alias for
\fBpngtopam\fP.
.PP
\fBpngtopnm\fP remained in the Netpbm package through Release 10.47
because it may have fewer bugs than \fBpngtopam\fP in those releases, and may
be faster in some environments.  But \fBpngtopnm\fP's incompatibility with
the most current PNG libraries makes it impractical to maintain along with
\fBpngtopam\fP now.
.PP
In releases before 10.48, you can use the \fBpngtopam\fP documentation for
\fBpngtopnm\fP, considering the following differences:



.IP \(bu
\fBpngtopnm\fP options are a subset of \fBpngtopam\fP's, as
documented above.

.IP \(bu
Any change that the \fBpngtopam\fP manual says happened in or
after Netpbm 10.44 doesn't apply to \fBpngtopnm\fP.
