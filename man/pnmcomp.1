.SH NAME

\fBpnmcomp\fP - replaced by pamcomp


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpnmcomp\fP was obsoleted by
.BR "\fBpamcomp\fP" (1)\c
\&,
introduced with Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).  \fBpamcomp\fP is backward
compatible with \fBpnmcomp\fP, plus adds many additional functions.  Among
this is the ability to process PAM images, including those with transparency
channels.
.PP
\fBpnmcomp\fP remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.68 (September
2014) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than \fBpamcomp\fP because of
its age.  But now it would just be clutter.
.PP
In Netpbm before 10.21, use the manual for \fBpamcomp\fP with
\fBpnmcomp\fP.  Features that are in \fBpamcomp\fP but not \fBpnmcomp\fP
are indicated by statements that they didn't exist before 10.21.
