.SH NAME

\fBpnmcut\fP - replaced by pamcut


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpnmcut\fP was obsoleted by
.BR "\fBpamcut\fP" (1)\c
\&, introduced with Netpbm 9.20 (May
2001).  \fBpamcut\fP is backward compatible with \fBpnmcut\fP, plus
adds many additional functions, including the ability to process PAM
images.
.PP
\fBpnmcut\fP remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than \fBpamcut\fP because of its
age.  But now it would just be clutter.
.PP
In Netpbm before 9.20, use the manual for \fBpamcut\fP with
\fBpnmcut\fP.  Features that are in \fBpamcut\fP but not \fBpnmcut\fP
are indicated by statements that they didn't exist before 9.20.
