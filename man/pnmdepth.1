.SH NAME
pnmdepth - change the maxval in a PNM image

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
Starting with Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), \fBpnmdepth\fP is
obsolete.  Use
.BR "\fBpamdepth\fP" (1)\c
\& instead.

\fBpamdepth\fP is backward compatible with \fBpnmdepth\fP.  You can
use the \fBpamdepth\fP manual for \fBpnmdepth\fP as long as you ignore
features that were added after Netpbm 10.31.
.PP
For backward compatibility, the name 'pnmdepth' continues to exist
as an alias for 'pamdepth'.  But because of a bug, that name doesn't work
in Netpbm 10.32.  You have to fix the symbolic link.
