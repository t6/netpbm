\fBpnmflip\fP was replaced in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002) by
.BR "pamflip" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamflip\fP is mostly backward compatible with \fBpnmflip\fP,
but works on PAM images too.
.PP
One way \fBpamflip\fP is not backward compatible with \fBpnmflip\fP
is that \fBpnmflip\fP lets you specify any number of basic flip options,
whereas \fBpamflip\fP requires exactly one.  (\fBpamflip\fP provides
the \fB-xform\fP option for requesting multiple transformations, though).
Because of this incompatibility, \fBpnmflip\fP still exists as a
separate program, and all it does is translate its options to \fBpamflip\fP
style and run \fBpamflip\fP.
.PP
You should not make any new use of \fBpnmflip\fP and if you modify an
existing use, you should upgrade to \fBpamflip\fP.  But note that if you
write a program that might have to be used with very old
Netpbm, \fBpnmflip\fP is the only way to do that.
