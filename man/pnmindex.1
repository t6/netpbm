two hyphens instead of one.  You can separate an option name from its value
with white space instead of an equals sign.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.

\fBpnmindex\fP creates an index image containing thumbnail (small)
versions of a bunch of PNM files you supply.  (Akin to a photographic
"contact sheet."
.PP
\fBpnmindex\fP labels each thumbnail and, optionally, contains a
title.
.PP
If you just want to concatenate some images together in a grid, use
\fBpamundice\fP for that.
.PP
If you want to take apart the image you generated with \fBpnmindex\fP,
use \fBpamdice\fP or \fBpamcut\fP.
.PP
The program can generate large temporary files.  By default, these go in
directory \fB/tmp\fP, but you can usse the \fBTMPDIR\fP environment variable
to have them somewhere else.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-size=\fP\fIN\fP
The size of each thumbnail.  The image is scaled to fit maximally
inside a \fIN\fP x \fIN\fP pixel box without changing its aspect
ratio.  Default is 100.

.TP
\fB-across=\fP\fIN\fP
The number of thumbnails in each row.  Default is 6.

.TP
\fB-colors=\fP\fIN\fP
The maximum number of colors allowed in the overall image.  If it
would otherwise have more colors than these, \fBpnmindex\fP quantizes
the result.  The default is 256.
.sp
However, this value is meaningless if you specify the
\fB-noquant\fP option.

.TP
\fB-black\fP
This controls the color of the padding between the images;
normally it's white and the labels are black lettering on white
background, but the \fB-black\fP option reverses this.

.TP
\fB-title=\fP\fItitle\fP
Specifies a title top place at the top of the image.
Default is no title.

.TP
\fB-quant\fP
Enables quantization (to the number of colors specified by
\fB-colors\fP).  Quantization is on by default but you can disable
it with \fB-noquant.\fP

.TP
\fB-noquant\fP
See \fB-quant\fP.
