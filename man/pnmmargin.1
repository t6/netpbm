.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpnmmargin\fP
[\fB-white\fP|\fB-black\fP|\fB-color\fP \fIcolorspec\fP] \fIsize\fP
[\fIpnmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpnmmargin\fP adds a border around a PNM image.


.UN arguments
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
\fIpnmfile\fP is the name of the input file.  If you don't specify this
argument, \fBpnmmargin\fP reads the input image from its Standard Input.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
You can specify the border color with the \fB-white\fP,
\fB-black\fP, and \fB-color\fP options.  If you don't specify a color, the
program makes a guess.
.PP
The value of \fB-color\fP is like the
.UR libnetpbm_image.html#colorname
argument of the \fBpnm_parsecolor()\fP library routine
.UE
\&.
.PP
To remove a border of a specified size from an image, use
\fBpamcut\fP.  \fBpnmcrop\fP also removes borders, but determines by itself
what is border and what is subject.
.PP
For lower level control, including to add different size borders to
different sides of the image, look at \fBpnmcat\fP.
.PP
If all you're trying to do is get the image up to a certain required
size, \fBpamcut\fP may be what you want.
.PP
\fBpnmpad\fP does essentially the same thing, but gives you more control
over the individual margins and does only black and white margins.
