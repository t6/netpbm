.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpnmpaste\fP reads two PNM images as input and inserts the first
image (the "pasted image") into the second (the "base image") at the
specified location, and produces a PNM image the same size and type as
the base image as output.
.PP
Either file name argument (but not both) may be '-' to indicate
Standard Input.  If you don't specify the second file argument at all, that's
the same as '-'.
.PP
\fIx\fP and \fIy\fP specify the location in the base image at
which to put the top left corner of the pasted image, \fIx\fP giving
the horizontal position and \fIx\fP giving the vertical position.  A
nonnegative value indicates the number of pixels right of the right
edge or below the top edge of the base image, while a negative value
indicates the number of pixels right of the right edge or below the
bottom edge (so x = -5 means 5 pixels left of the right edge).
.PP
If any part of the pasted image does not fit within the base image,
\fBpnmpaste\fP fails.
.PP
This tool is most useful in combination with \fIpamcut\fP.  For
instance, if you want to edit a small segment of a large image, and
your image editor cannot edit the large image, you can cut out the
segment you are interested in, edit it, and then paste it back in.
.PP
Another useful companion tool is \fBpbmmask\fP.
.PP
\fBpamcomp\fP is a more general tool, except that it lacks the
"or," "and," and "xor" functions.
\fBpamcomp\fP allows you to specify a transparency mask in order to have
only part of the inserted image get inserted.  So the inserted pixels
need not be a rectangle.  You can also have the inserted image be
translucent, so the resulting image is a mixture of the inserted image
and the base image.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The option specifies the operation to use when doing the paste.
The default is \fB-replace\fP, which means to do the obvious paste:
replace pixels of the "into" image with those of the
"from" image.
.PP
\fB-and\fP, \fB-or\fP, and \fB-xor\fP are allowed only if both
input images are PBM images.  They say to combine the "from" and
"into" images by performing boolean operations:  Each pixel of
the output image is the result of the boolean operation on the corresponding
pixels of the two input image, where white is TRUE and black is FALSE.
.PP
Note that this is different from what you would get by doing a bit
arithmetic on the bits in the PBM images, because in PBM, white is
represented by a 0 bit, and 0 in bit arithmetic corresponds to FALSE
in boolean arithmetic.
