.SH NAME

\fBpnmscale\fP - replaced by pamscale


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpnmscale\fP was obsoleted by
.BR "\fBpamscale\fP" (1)\c
\&, introduced with Netpbm 10.20
(January 2004).  \fBpamscale\fP is backward compatible with \fBpnmscale\fP,
plus adds many additional functions, including the ability to process PAM
images.
.PP
\fBpnmscale\fP remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than \fBpamscale\fP because of
its age.  But now it would just be clutter.
.PP
In Netpbm before 10.20, use the manual for \fBpamscale\fP with
\fBpnmscale\fP.  Features that are in \fBpamscale\fP but not \fBpnmscale\fP
are indicated by statements that they didn't exist before 10.20.
