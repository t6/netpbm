This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.

\fBpnmtile\fP reads a PNM image as input.  It replicates it to fill
an area of the specified dimensions and produces an image in the same
format as output.
.PP
You can do pretty much the reverse with \fBpamdice\fP.
.PP
You can explicitly concatenate an image to itself (or anything else)
with \fBpnmcat\fP.

If you're trying to tile multiple images into a superimage,
see \fBpamundice\fP or (for a thumbnail sheet) \fBpnmindex\fP.
