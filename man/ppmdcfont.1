.SH NAME

ppmdcfont - Turn a Ppmdfont file into C source for a builtin font

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmdcfont\fP


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
(There are no arguments or options)
.PP
\fBppmdcfont\fP creates a C source file that you can compile into
a built-in font for use with the Netpbm PPM drawing facilities.  It
reads a Ppmdfont file on Standard Input and writes the C source code to
Standard Output.
.PP
The output C source code has the font object's name hardcoded as
\fBppmd_standardfont\fP, which you will definitely want to edit,
because that is the name of the font built in to \fBlibnetpbm\fP.  If
you don't change it, it will conflict both cognitively and in program
linking.  There should obviously be an option on \fBppmdcfont\fP to
choose this, but the development effort has not been justified so far.
