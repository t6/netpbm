.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBppmdither\fP reads a Netpbm image as input, and applies dithering
to it to reduce the number of colors used down to the specified number
of shades for each primary.  It produces a PPM image as output.
.PP
The default number of shades is 5 red, 9 green, and 5 blue, for a total of
225 colors.  To convert the image to a binary rgb format suitable for
primitive color printers, use \fB-red=2 -green=2 -blue=2\fP.
.PP
You can do another kind of dither -- Floyd-Steinberg -- with 
\fBpnmquant\fP or \fBpnmremap\fP.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-dim\fP \fIpower\fP
 The size of the dithering matrix.  The dithering matrix is a
square whose dimension is a power of 2.  \fIpower\fP is that power of
2.  The default is 4, for a 16 by 16 matrix.

.TP
\fB-red\fP=\fIn\fP
The number of red shades to be used, including black; minimum of 2.
.sp
Default is 5.

.TP
\fB-green\fP \fIn\fP
The number of green shades to be used, including black; minimum of 2.
.sp
Default is 9.

.TP
