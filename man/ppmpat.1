.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBppmpat\fP produces a PPM of the specified width and height,
with a pattern in it.
.PP
You could, for example, use it to create wallpaper for a computer screen.
.PP
One use of this program is as an example of the Netpbm library
.BR "drawing" (3)\c
\& functions, which it uses.
.PP
Some of the patterns have large numbers of colors, so if you want
a simpler pattern, use \fBpnmquant\fP on the output.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options specify various pattern types:


.TP
\fB-gingham2\fP
A gingham check pattern.  Can be tiled.
.sp
If you specify -color, give two colors: background and foreground, in that
order.

.TP
\fB-gingham3\fP
A slightly more complicated gingham.  Can be tiled.
.sp
If you specify -color, give three colors: background and two foregrounds,
in that order.

.TP
\fB-madras\fP
A madras plaid.  Can be tiled.
.sp
If you specify -color, give three colors: background and two foregrounds,
in that order.

.TP
\fB-tartan\fP
A tartan plaid.  Can be tiled.
.sp
If you specify -color, give three colors: background and two foregrounds,
in that order.

.TP
\fB-poles\fP
Color gradients centered on randomly-placed poles.
.sp
If you specify -color, give two or more colors.

.TP
\fB-squig\fP
Squiggley tubular pattern.  Can be tiled.
.sp
If you specify -color, give three or more colors.  The first is the
background color.

.TP
\fB-camo\fP
Camouflage pattern.
.sp
If you specify \fB-color\fP, give three or more colors.  The first is the
background color; the others are colors for the leafy foreground shapes.
The foreground shapes will probably occupy nearly the entire image, so that the
background color is barely visible.

.TP
\fB-anticamo\fP
Anti-camouflage pattern - like -camo, but ultra-bright colors.
.sp
If you specify \fB-color\fP, this is the same as \fB-camo\fP.

.TP
\fB-argyle1\fP
A diamond argyle pattern, without a cross through the diamond, with one
diamond.  Can be tiled.
.sp
If you specify -color, give two colors: background and foreground, in that
order.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.78 (March 2017).

.TP
\fB-argyle2\fP
A diamond argyle pattern, with a cross through the diamond, with one
diamond.  Can be tiled.
.sp
If you specify -color, give three colors: background, foreground, and
stripe, in that order.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.78 (March 2017).

.TP
\fB-color\fP \fIcolorlist\fP
This specifies the colors to appear in the pattern.
.sp
If you do not specify this option, \fBppmpat\fP chooses colors at random.
.sp
Different patterns take different numbers of colors.  Some can involve
variable numbers of colors.  If you specify a number of colors incompatible
with the pattern you specify, \fBppmpat\fP fails, telling you how many colors
to specify.
.sp
\fIcolorlist\fP is a comma-separated list of colors.
.sp
Specify each color as described for the 
.UR libnetpbm_image.html#colorname
argument of the \fBpnm_parsecolor()\fP library routine
.UE
\&.
.sp
Example: \fB-color red, green, rgbi:1.0/0.5/.25\fP .
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.78 (March 2017).

.TP
\fB-randomseed\fP \fIinteger\fP
This is the seed for the random number generator that generates the
pixels.
.sp
Use this to ensure you get the same image on separate invocations.
.sp
By default, \fBppmpat\fP uses a seed derived from the time of day
and process ID, which gives you fairly uncorrelated results in multiple
invocations.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).
