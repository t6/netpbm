.SH NAME

ppmtoapplevol - convert a PPM into an Apple volume label image

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtoapplevol\fP

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBppmtoapplevol\fP reads a PPM image as input and produces an Apple
volume label image as output.
.PP
EFI-based Apple systems use a simple image format to provide textual labels
for devices.  This program generates that format.
.PP
The input image must be exactly 12 rows tall.  Use \fBpamfile\fP to
see how tall your image is and \fBpamscale\fP or \fBpamcut\fP to make
it 12 rows if it isn't.
.PP
Netpbm does not have a converter for the other direction.
