.SH NAME

ppmtomap - create a map of all colors in a PPM image

.UN lbAC
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
This program exists only for backward compatibility.
.PP
Use \fBpnmcolormap\fP, which replaced it in January 2002.
.PP
One trivial difference between \fBppmtomap\fP and \fBpnmcolormap
all\fP is that if the input is PBM or PGM, \fBppmtomap\fP would
produce PPM output, whereas \fBpnmcolormap all\fP produces the same
kind of output as the input.  This should not be very noticeable,
though, as PBM and PGM images are usually usable anywhere a PPM image
is.
