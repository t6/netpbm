.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBppmwheel\fP produces a PPM image of a color wheel of the
specified diameter inside a white square just large enough to hold it.
.PP
The color wheel is based on the HSV color model.  Hues are distributed
  angularly around the circle and the values and saturations are distributed
  radially.
.PP
You can generate three kinds of color wheel:

.IP \(bu
Hue-value: Select this with a \fB-huevalue\fP option.
.sp
The saturation is 100% everywhere.  The value goes from zero to 100%
  linearly, from the center of the wheel to the edge.  So the center is black.
.sp
Hence, the image consists of all of the secondary colors based on the
  red, green, and blue primary colors.  A secondary color is one that is
  composed of light of at most two of the three primary colors.

.IP \(bu
Hue-saturation: Select this with a \fB-huesaturation\fP option.
.sp
The value is 100% everywhere.  The saturation goes from zero to 100%
  linearly, from the center of the wheel to the edge.  So the center is white.

.IP \(bu
Ppmcirc: Select this by not specifying any other wheel type option.
.sp
The saturation is 100% everywhere.  The value is a strange function of
  the distance from the center, increasing as the square root of the distance
  until halfway out, then decreasing as the 8th root of the distance the rest
  of the way.  We don't know what the point of this is, but it is what the
  program Ppmcirc by Peter Kirchgessner in 1995 does, and was the only option
  in \fBppmwheel\fP from its inception in 2003 to 2019.
      



.UN arguments
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
You must specify one non-option argument: the radius of the color wheel
in pixels.
.PP
This is also the height and width of the output image.
