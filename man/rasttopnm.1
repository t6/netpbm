.SH NAME

rasttopnm - convert a Sun rasterfile to a PNM image

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrasttopnm\fP

[\fB-index\fP]

[\fIrastfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBrasttopnm\fP reads a Sun rasterfile as input and produces a PNM
image as output.  The type of the output file depends on the input
file - if it's black and white, \fBrasttopnm\fP writes a PBM image.
If it's grayscale, \fBrasttopnm\fP writes a PGM.  If it's color,
\fBrasttopnm\fP writes a PPM.  The program tells you which type it is
generating.

.SH OPTIONS


  
.TP
\fB-index\fP
This odd option tells \fBrasttopnm\fP to use the color map indices in
the raster as if they are the color values.
.sp
In a colormapped Sun rasterfile, the header of the file contains a color
map, associating each unique color that occurs in the file with an index
number.  The raster portion of the file then represents the color of a pixel
with one of those colormap indices.
.sp
This option has found use as follows: take a regular grayscale Sun
rasterfile in which all the grayscale value are represented, so the colormap
indices are identical to the color values.  Modify its color map so as to
alter the colors in the image, in particular to equalize the colors.  With
that modified rasterfile as input, \fBrasttopnm\fP without \fB-index\fP
produces the modified image.  But with \fB-index\fP, it produces the original
unmodified image.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011).
