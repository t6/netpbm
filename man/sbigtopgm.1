This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c

\fBsbigtopgm\fP reads an image file in the native format used
by the Santa Barbara Instrument Group (SBIG) astronomical CCD cameras,
and produces a PGM image as output.  Additional information on SBIG
cameras and documentation of the file format is available at the Web
site,

\fBsbigtopgm\fP recognizes some variation on the documented SBIG Type 3
format.  It allows any capitalization in the header.  It ignores all
whitespace in the header except newlines.  So a header line can end in
newline, CRLF, or the bizarre LF-CR actually required by the spec.
