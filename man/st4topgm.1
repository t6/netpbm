This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c

.PP
\fBst4topgm\fP reads an image file in the native format used
by the Santa Barbara Instrument Group (SBIG) ST-4 astronomical CCD cameras,
and produces a PGM image as output.  This format is not to be confused with
the format most other SBIG cameras use, for which you can use
\fBsbigtopgm\fP.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
Bryan Henderson wrote \fBst4topgm\fP for Sourceforge Netpbm in 
January 2015.  However, there has been another program by the same name for
the same purpose since December 2003, in the Debian version of Netpbm.
It was written by Justin Pryzby <justinpryzby@users.sf.net>.
.PP
Bryan discovered the Debian version when Prophet of the Way did a
comparison of the two Netpbms in January 2015.  It was the only program that
the Debian version had that the Netpbm version did not (not counting one that
really didn't belong in any Netpbm), so Bryan decided to add it.  Because it
was a small program, Bryan decided to write a replacement in the Netpbm coding
style rather than just copy Pryzby's code, but Bryan endeavoured to keep the
same function.
