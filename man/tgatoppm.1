.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBtgatoppm\fP reads a TrueVision Targa file as input and produces
a PPM image as output.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.



.TP
\fB--alphaout=\fP\fIalpha-filename\fP
\fBtgatoppm \fP creates a PGM image containing the transparency channel
values in the input image.  If the input image doesn't contain an
transparency channel, the \fIalpha-filename\fP file contains all zero
(transparent) transparency values.  If you don't specify \fB--alphaout\fP,
\fBtgatoppm\fP does not generate an alpha file, and if the input
image has a transparency channel, \fBtgatoppm\fP simply discards it.
.sp
If you specify \fB-\fP as the filename, \fBtgatoppm\fP writes the
transparency output to Standard Output and discards the image.
.sp
See
.BR "pamcomp" (1)\c
\& for one way to use
the transparency output file.

.TP
\fB--headerdump\fP
Causes \fBtgatoppm\fP to dump information from the TGA header to
Standard Error.
