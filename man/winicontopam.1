.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fB-andmasks\fP]

All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You
may use either white space or equals signs between an option name and
its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBwinicontopam\fP reads a Microsoft Windows icon file and
converts it to one or more RGB_ALPHA Netpbm PAM files.
.PP
The transparency channel is copied from the 8-bit transparency data from
the icon, if present.  If no 8-bit transparency data is available, the
transparency channel is constructed from the so-called "AND mask".
.PP
The output goes to Standard Output.
.PP
The output is a multi-image PAM file.  If you want a separate file for
each image, use
.BR "\fBpamsplit\fP" (1)\c
\&.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS

In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably \fB-quiet\fP, see 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
Common Options
.UE
\&), \fBwinicontopam\fP recognizes the following command
line options:



.TP
\fB-allimages\fP
Convert all images in the input.
.sp
You may not specify this together with \fB-image\fP.
.sp
By default, \fBwinicontopam\fP converts only the one "best
quality" image (largest, then most bits per pixel).

.TP
\fB-image=\fP\fIindex\fP
Convert image number \fIindex\fP (starting with zero).
.sp
You may not specify this together with \fB-allimages\fP.
.sp
By default, \fBwinicontopam\fP converts the "best quality"
image (largest, then most bits per pixel).

.TP
\fB-andmasks\fP
If the image to be extracted contains both 8-bit transparency
data and AND mask, write a five-channel Netpbm PAM file with the AND
mask stored to the fifth plane.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print more messages

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBwinicontopam\fP was new in Netpbm 10.63 (June 2013).  It obsoleted
\fBwinicontoppm\fP by providing more function and conforming better to Netpbm
conventions.
