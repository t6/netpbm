.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBximtoppm\fP

[\fB--alphaout=\fP{\fIalpha-filename\fP,\fB-\fP}]
[\fIximfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBximptoppm\fP reads an Xim file as input and produces a PPM
image as output.  The Xim toolkit is included in the contrib tree of
the X.V11R4 release.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.


.TP
\fB--alphaout=\fP\fIalpha-filename\fP
\fBximtoppm\fP creates a PGM file containing the transparency channel
values in the input image.  If the input image doesn't contain a
transparency channel, the \fIalpha-filename\fP file contains all zero
(transparent) transparency values.  If you don't specify \fB--alphaout\fP,
\fBximtoppm\fP does not generate a transparency file, and if the input
image has a transparency channel, \fBximtoppm\fP simply discards it.
.sp
If you specify \fB-\fP as the filename, \fBximtoppm\fP writes the
transparency output to Standard Output and discards the image.
.sp
Actually, an Xim image can contain an arbitrary fourth channel --
it need not be a transparency channel.  \fBximtoppm\fP extracts any fourth
channel it finds as described above; it doesn't matter if it is a
transparency channel or not.
.sp
See
.BR "pamcomp" (1)\c
\& for one way to use
the transparency output file.
