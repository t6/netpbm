.SH NAME

xpmtoppm - convert an X11 pixmap to a PPM image

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fB--alphaout=\fP{\fIalpha-filename\fP,\fB-\fP}]
[\fB-verbose\fP]

[\fIxpmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBxpbtoppm\fP reads an X11 pixmap (XPM version 1 or 3) as input
and produces a PPM image as output.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB--alphaout=\fP\fIalpha-filename\fP
\fBxpmtoppm\fP creates a PBM file containing the transparency
mask for the image.  If the input image doesn't contain transparency
information, the \fIalpha-filename\fP file contains all white
(opaque) transparency values.  If you don't specify \fB--alphaout\fP,
\fBxpmtoppm\fP does not generate a transparency file, and if the input
image has transparency information, \fBxpmtoppm\fP simply discards
it.
.sp
If you specify \fB-\fP as the filename, \fBxpmtoppm\fP writes the
transparency output to Standard Output and discards the image.
.sp
See
.BR "pamcomp" (1)\c
\& for one way to use
the transparency output file.
.sp
\fBxpmtoppm\fP can't handle a line longer than 8K characters in
the XPM input.  If an input line exceeds this limit,
\fBxpmtoppm\fP quits with an error message to that effect.  Before
Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005), the limit was 2K.

.TP
\fB--verbose\fP
\fBxpmtoppm\fP prints information about its processing on Standard Error.



.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
\fBxpmtoppm\fP recognizes only a limited set of the features of XPM
Version 3; i.e. it rejects as invalid many valid XPM images.
.PP
The only place a comment block is valid is starting in Column 1 of the
line immediately after "static char ...".
.PP
In addition, \fBppmtoxpm\fP properly recognizes any single-line
comment that begins in Column 1 in the color table part of the file.
.PP
There must be for every pixel a default colorname for a color type visual.
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.58 (March 2012), zero bytes per pixel causes the program
to fail with a message about premature EOF on input.
